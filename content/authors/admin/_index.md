Hi!I am a Full Stack Developer at Fidelity Investments with a knack for problem solving related to large-scale Java applications. I majorly work on delivering libraries and microservices.

I am also an open-minded individual and focus on never-ending professional self-improvement.
Apart from coding, I practice yoga during my free time.
